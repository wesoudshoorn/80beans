Design starts with words. They are the form that our ideas take when we communicate. Design can make them stronger, but never change them.

One of my personal heroes, George Lois, calls himself a "visual communicator". I like this term better than "designer". If I want to be a better communicator, I have to practice with words.

Therefore, after years of silence on my personal domain, I am starting to write. Give form to my ideas, by communicating them through this blog.
