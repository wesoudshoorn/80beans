intro: It came to me. Two types of websites. The theater seat and the couch in front of your television.

The theater forces you to sit in a chair. Watch the full show. There is one stage, one spotlight and one storyline. Your phone should be off. You don't talk during the show. This limited choice can be a place of rest in the ever expanding world of choices.

In contrast, there is the TV. We control the remote. Hundreds of channels. Short programs. Don't forget your smartphones and tablets with their push notifications, instant messages and tweets. The toilet breaks, getting a drink, pausing a show. The experience lacks focus all together. You are in control.

How will you present your content? Will you tell the story as a theater show? A long, one-page story? A single video on your homepage? Do you demand focus and attention, do you control the order of consumation? 

Or will you carefully make all the content accesible for your visitors, by clear navigation, easy to scan blocks with the ability to go into detail and back?
