intro: Sometimes I hear about friction between developers & designers. It is so easy to blame eachother. But it might be easier to start getting along.

I have worked im a design team for a while, without developers. We delivered PSD files. I hardly ever saw projects come to life. And when we did, there was a load of frustration about the implementation of our work. 

Imagine the same train of thoughts from a developer. He gets a bunch of pixel-perfect designs, and runs into the reality of the browser. Than he makes choices under the pressure of deadlines. He does what he thinks is best.

If you recognize this situation somewhat, nobody is to blame! Only you are to blame. You should have walked up to a developer and say: "hi, how are you doing, is everything clear?" 

It is even better to invite a developer to give input during your design process. It's surprising how much trouble you can avoid by a five minute meeting.

But the most fun, is to share a desk. You can see the developer being uber-geeky in the terminal (the black thingy with letters). The developer can see how much shortcuts you know in Photoshop. You'll grow fond of eachother, learn from eachother and start loving eachother. 

So get up now and give the developer closest to you a hug. Tell him you're sorry and you want it to be better between the both of you. Or just start with a friendly "hi, I'm the designer".
