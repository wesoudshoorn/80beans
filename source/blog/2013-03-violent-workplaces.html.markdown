I have seen a lot of violence in the workplace. You might think I've seen people in fistfights, throwing laptops through a window, but I mean a different kind of violence. For me, violence is neglecting another persons needs.

We're all human beings. It's easy to forget that in a stressful workplace. But we all have our needs, hopes and wishes. We're all trying to be a better version of us.

Empathy might be the best way to get there. Seeing to eachothers needs as you would your own. If we do this every day, we will change the people around us and the companies they work in.
